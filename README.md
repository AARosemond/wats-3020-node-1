## Input/Output for this Code

This assignment uses the local module **getargs** to pull a single argument out of the command line for input and `console.log(<string>)` for all output.

## Basic Requirements

In order to complete this project successfully, you will need to fulfill these requirements:
* Go through `index.js` in the `1-experiments` folder, complete all of the TODOs, and observe the output.
* Complete the conditional logic and console output statements in `index.js` in the `2-odd-even` folder such that the program identifies whether a number input is even or odd and reports accordingly.
* Complete the conditional logic and console output statements in `index.js` in the `3-string-contains-hello` folder such that the program properly reports whether a string contains the `hello`.
* Complete the conditional logic, variable declarations, and correct calculations in `index.js` in the `4-hours-to-minutes` folder such that the program properly converts a whole number of minutes into the correct number of hours and minutes.
* Write a small JavaScript program in `index.js` in the `mini-app` folder that meets these requirements:
  * Reads an argument from the command line;
  * Provides a usage statement if the input is in not correct; 
  * Uses an if/then statement; and
  * Uses at least one operator (+, -, *, /, %)

## Stretch Goals

1. Use the `prompt` and `console.log` commands and implement your mini-app in a web page.
2. Create an app to determine if a number is divisible by 3 or 7.
3. Research the string methods and write an app that uses the search or substr method to find a string within a string.
4. Research the string methods and write an app the determines how long a string is.
5. Research the number methods and write an app the converts a string containing a integer into a numeric integer.  This is a useful bit of code, since we often pull strings off the web when accessing data and need to convert it into numbers in our code.
